## About me
I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, advised by Prof. Shan Lu. 

I'm currently working on applying formal methods to provide better end-user programming experience in smart home.  More specifically,  I'm interested in developing tools that could help users to debug, diagnose or synthesize trigger-action programs in their smart home.

I got my bachelor degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University in 2017.

## Research Project
**AutoTap** 

It is a tool that uses formal specifications to verify, debug or synthesize trigger-action programs in smart home. It provides a user-friendly interface allowing users to turn their requirements into formal specifications from only clicking. By analyzing automata of the current system, it identifies potential violations and suggests patches.

A demo could be found [here](https://youtu.be/gAtLgqD2yHQ) (please watch with subtitles on).

## Publication
 - AutoTap: Synthesizing and Repairing Trigger-Action Programs Using LTL Properties, to appear in ICSE'19

## Awards
 - 2017: Ceres scholar for incoming PhD students
